      <p>
        I was at Thomson Reuters for 3 years as a Product Manager where I worked
        with clients at Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Nomura,
        and Rothschild to create Thomson Reuters' MS Excel to MS PowerPoint
        linking application which enabled users to use Excel data & graphs with
        linked data in PowerPoint presentations. Although there is a Microsoft
        Office native equivalent, we were able to develop a product that was
        more stable and with a feature set more tailored to our clients needs.
