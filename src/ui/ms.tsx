        <p>
          My first role at Morgan Stanley was creating automated spreadsheet
          models. I worked with a wide variety of financial data and developed a
          query and reporting engine that worked against Sybase databases. Over
          a period of 14 years I filled the roles of software developer, team
          lead, development manager, project manager and product manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications I worked on concerned CRM, Knowledge Management, Document
          Management, Banker & Analyst Productivity, reducing information
          overload, Firmwide Branding and pitchbook automation. I have often
          been called 'the grandfather of pitchbook automation', although
          dropping the 'grand' would be fine with me.
